Hey Brother,

This is a post to generate an idea I had regarding making a interactive 3D printing experience on twitch.

The scenario goes as follows:

1.Point webcam at 3D printer
2.Broadcast stream of 3D printer action
3.Parse twitch chat to generate G-Code(machine code)
(http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code)
4.Run G-Code on 3D printer with parameters that make real 3D models.
5.Raffle off decent models every week for subs.
