An homage to my mentor Michael T Miyoshi.

Feel free to purchase his book:
"Musings of a Mediocre Man"

Yes, you can also find his works for free online.  Its kindof the theme of this whole thing :D

#### Why are you here?
A stranger probably linked you here.  Either that or you are one of the 5 people who actually end up
listening (because they know me).

#### Core Philosophy
1.  Hippocratic Oath
2.  Form `opinions`, which are not funtementally worse than `fact`
3.  evaluate your opinions based on YOUR perfect information (you can always find more on Google~)
4.  evaluate your opinions in leu of NEW information (provided by tv, peers, or other sources)
5.  Think, be yourself, and have fun.

#### To do lists
- [ ] does this work? it does!  (`checkbox => - [ ]`)
- [ ] scaffold out dir structure
- [ ] convert audio into something that sounds better
- [ ] break it into parts? maybe.. I like as-is (convince me otherwise)
